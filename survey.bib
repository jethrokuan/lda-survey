  abstract =     {Latent Dirichlet analysis, or topic modeling, is a
                  flexible latent variable framework for modeling
                  high-dimensional sparse count data. Various learning
                  algorithms have been developed in recent years,
                  including collapsed Gibbs sampling, variational
                  inference, and maximum a posteriori estimation, and
                  this variety motivates the need for careful
                  empirical comparisons. In this paper, we highlight
                  the close connections between these approaches. We
                  find that the main differences are attributable to
                  the amount of smoothing applied to the counts. When
                  the hyperparameters are optimized, the differences
                  in performance among the algorithms diminish
                  significantly. The ability of these algorithms to
                  achieve solutions of comparable accuracy gives us
                  the freedom to select computationally efficient
                  approaches. Using the insights gained from this
                  comparative study, we show how accurate topic models
                  can be learned in several seconds on text corpora
                  with thousands of documents.},

  abstract =     {Topic models are one of the most popular methods for
                  learning representations of text, but a major
                  challenge is that any change to the topic model
                  requires mathematically deriving a new inference
                  algorithm. A promising approach to address this
                  problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB),
                  but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic
                  models in practice. We present what is to our
                  knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference
                  method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which
                  we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic
                  Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems
                  caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by
                  component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches
                  traditional methods in accuracy with much better
                  inference time. Indeed, because of the inference
                  network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the
                  computational cost of running variational
                  optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black
                  box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a
                  dramatic illustration of this, we present a new
                  topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the
                  mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By
                  changing only one line of code from LDA, we find
                  that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics,
                  even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs
                  sampling.},

  abstract =     {We introduce the adversarially learned inference
                  (ALI) model, which jointly learns a generation
                  network and an inference network using an
                  adversarial process. The generation network maps
                  samples from stochastic latent variables to the data
                  space while the inference network maps training
                  examples in data space to the space of latent
                  variables. An adversarial game is cast between these
                  two networks and a discriminative network is trained
                  to distinguish between joint latent/data-space
                  samples from the generative network and joint
                  samples from the inference network. We illustrate
                  the ability of the model to learn mutually coherent
                  inference and generation networks through the
                  inspections of model samples and reconstructions and
                  confirm the usefulness of the learned
                  representations by obtaining a performance
                  competitive with state-of-the-art on the
                  semi-supervised SVHN and CIFAR10 tasks.},
